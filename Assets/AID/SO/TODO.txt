Demo moves to tests

coroutine runner
system base
audio doesn't need the enum anymore
confirm that pool makes sense with current SO setup
var doesn't need to show current value if its not in play mode


gameobject var?

extvars, put gen vars in sub folder rather than sub SO, they are harder for users to deal with when sub SO.

external vars
?should move to smarter file container
should be able to manually add more types in the editor and push those back out to a csv, etc.?
-YES, use the editor script to be able to add types based on names and SO types in the handlers list
--need a list/button for adding new items

external vars col
-needs to be able to make all extvars reload from live data

-

FileSO
-backed by one of;
--local textasset
--file in Resources
--file in StreamingAssets
-can move to persist and load from there if present
-name to store it as in persist or streamingassets
-URL for live data
it should version, how
-can't rely on csv, they aren't all going to be that
-can't do file names some urls won't allow it
prepare
-checks for local files, if not present copies from internal
CheckRemote
-hits remote url to determine if it is valid
Download
-dls remote file


FileManifestSO 
-collection of all FileSO
-current manifest
-temp maifest
-

Refactor filedownloadwindow so we can use it at runtime too
